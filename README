Purpose:
1. Creates a corotating polytropic binary system in cylindrical coordinates.
3. The output can be used in hydrodynamics code as initial model.

Required:
1. Nothing except reasonable guesses of the boundaries A, B, C the binary system.
   A = Outer edge of the primary
   B = Inner edge of the primary
   C = Inner edge of the secondary
   Specified in file init, starting second number, second line.
   Also the central densities, right after C.
2. Other needed parameters are specified in runscf.h file.
   
How to use:
1. For the very first run with given resolution, make sure that in main.F90, have_green_funcs = .false.
   This can be changed to .true. for later runs with the same resolutions for a faster runtime.
2. Do:
   >> make clean
   >> make
   >> ./scf
   
Note:
Code is also known as corrected SCF code. The very first attempt at creating biplytropic binary
had some issues with convergence. Patrick Motl provided me with this version of SCF which used 
different Poisson solver, and it works.
